This is a fork of adactio's Pattern Primer (https://github.com/adactio/Pattern-Primer).

The idea is to have a small, atomic markup snippet library where elements are styled from the content out. 

These patterns are also part of the One Web Boilerplate: https://github.com/akikoo/one-web-boilerplate.
